# QCI-Bio-Optimizer: Nature-Inspired Circuit Optimization for Dual-Rail Qubits

This project implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize quantum circuits designed for **QCIâ€™s Dual-Rail Qubit architecture**. Built using Qiskit and simulated on Google Colab, the optimizer evolves gate parameters to preserve valid dual-rail logical encodings while reducing error-prone outputs â€” a step toward hardware-aware, fault-tolerant circuit design.

## Why This Matters for Quantum Circuits Inc.

Quantum Circuits Inc. is pioneering superconducting quantum systems with **built-in error detection and real-time feedback control** through its Dual-Rail Qubit (DRQ) design. However, **compiler-level optimization** tailored for these systems is still an open opportunity.

This project explores:

- âœ… **Error-aware compilation** using biological evolution principles (Genetic Algorithms)
- âœ… **Hardware-aligned circuit design** that respects dual-rail encoding integrity
- âœ… A scalable optimization framework that can adapt to noise, mid-circuit resets, and parity checks

By simulating logical qubit integrity and optimizing control gates in a GA loop, this project creates a proof-of-concept for a **bio-inspired, QCI-compatible transpiler or quantum compiler module**.
